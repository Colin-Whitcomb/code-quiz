## Summary & Process

In this assignment our objective was to create a quiz game.

I started by organizing the HTML and the corresponding Javascript to iterate through questions. I later focused on the timer function, and lastly on the high score documentation. CSS design was done between large projects. 

In addition to the required components, I made sure to add "Correct!" and "Wrong!" messages to notify the user the accuracy of their answer (seen in screen-shot2) as well as decrementing the time left per every wrong answer.
